While preparing for the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification (CLF-C02), I embarked on a hands-on project to reinforce my knowledge and showcase my cloud engineering skills. My goal was to design and implement a highly available, scalable blog that could handle unpredictable traffic spikes and global content delivery â€” mirroring real-world cloud use cases. This project allowed me to dive deep into the intricacies of AWS services and develop a comprehensive understanding of cloud architecture.
I initially began using the AWS console, but switched to Terraform as it is much more efficient, allowing for automated, consistent deployments across environments.
